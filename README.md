# Code Challenge:

Write a function in javascript that calculates the Fibonacci sequence 
up to a given number n and returns the sequence as a list.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
For example, the Fibonacci sequence up to n = 10 would 
be: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34].
