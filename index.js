/*
Write a JavaScript function that calculates a variation of the Fibonacci
sequence consisting of 1000 elements, starting with two given 
numbers a and b, and returns the sequence as a list.

The variation of the Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

The sequence starts with the given numbers a and b.
Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
For example, given a = 2 and b = 5, the resulting variation of 
the Fibonacci sequence would be: [2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, ...], consisting 
of 1000 elements.

const fibonacci = (x, y) => {
    // write your code here...
};

module.exports = fibonacci;
